In the vast symphony of the cosmos, you are the most beautiful melody on the strings of my heart. As day merges into night, my feelings for you surge like the relentless tide, gently yet firmly, crashing upon the shore of our love. I yearn to take the stars as my pen, the moon as my ink, to scrawl your name across the sky, letting the world bear witness to the light you've brought into my life. Each word I write is imbued with my deep affection and boundless love for you.
